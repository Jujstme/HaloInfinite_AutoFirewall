# Auto Recorder
Tool for Team Sonic Racing (PC Steam Version) automatically stop/start OBS recording when races start/finish.
Ported over from the S&amp;ASRT version by Tyapp.

# How to use:
1. Download and install the OBS websocket plugin from here: https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/releases
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to somewhere on your computer.
2. Start OBS Studio.
3. Start the auto recorder .exe from the extracted files.

# The program will:
1. Start recording races when the countdown begins (or immediately if t,he app is started during a race)
2. Stop recording when the race ends and the results screen disappears
3. Stop recording if you restart/quit the race or close the game

# Notes:
You can open the program at any time, it will automatically connect to OBS and TSR when they are opened.
It works in online multiplayer, local races and grand prix.
